# Open Source Text Editor for Parkinson's

People with diseases such as Parkinson's have a hard time communicating.

This text editor, when loaded in a browser and paired with an accessible keyboard, will allow a disabled person to type.
My grandfather can't speak due to Parkinson's, and though he gets occaisonal hand tremors he can control his hand just enough to interface with a keyboard.
This IDE is a solution to that; with an autocorrect algorithm, he can make type the gist of a word and it will guess his intention. 

To do list:
1. Incorporate merriam webster wordlist into dictionary of known words
2. AI word completion implementation?
3. Remove delay in presenting words on screen
